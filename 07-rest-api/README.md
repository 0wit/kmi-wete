Simple REST API db that stores Users in current session that I spent waaay to much time on. :D After every action you need to manually return to the index site.
Developed for a web technologies course on UPOL in 2022/2023.

To test the task simply run: docker-compose up --build -d which creates containers in Docker which you need to have installed.
