Simple REST API db that stores Users in current session that I spent waaay to much time on. :D
Developed for a web technologies course on UPOL in 2022/2023.

To test the task simply run: docker-compose up --build -d which creates containers in Docker which you need to have installed.
On localhost:8000 you can then see all forms for testing the functionality of saving, updating and deleteing users.

ID has to be numeric and not empty, name and surname can.
